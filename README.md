# ExtractDownloadsDS
A script in R created to extract the number downloads from a a guestbook export of our DANS Data Stations. 
It receives as input an csv file with a list of datasets and their DOIs for which we want to collect download information and a guestbook export from our DANS Data Station where all actions are captured. 

In this initial case the script was used to extract downloads from 2023 of CBS datasets.
The script was again used in 2026 to extract downloads from 2024 and 2025 of CBS datasets, a new version of the script was updated.
