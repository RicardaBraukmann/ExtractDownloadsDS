# ExtractDownloadsDS
A script in R created to extract the number downloads from a a guestbook export of our DANS Data Stations. 
It receives as input an csv file with a list of datasets and their DOIs for which we want to collect download information and a guestbook export from our DANS Data Station where all actions are captured. 

In this initial case the script was used to extract downloads from 2023 of CBS datasets.
